TODO:

How to use tools to create a new manifest copy (without using robocopy)

rt:
	Ability to validate a single file or directory
	Don't change root directory when specifying manifest, so that manifest can live elsewhere
	-deep option for -recursive, or -deepRecursive - check for manifests underneath manifests when recursive (could make this very efficient so that each file is checked only once but would need to rewrite a lot)
	Ability to show file checksums
	Search upwards for manifest to allow narrow update, validate, etc.
	Utilize manifest information modified date
	Remove deprecated fields from ManifestFileInfo
	Locking of files - read-only


rs:
	Allow founding a new repository
	Check files on both ends as they are sent/received - stream splitter
	repair - define and implement
	allow non-default manifest names and locations
	Check for copies without moves
	Keep directories and manifest directories clean - remove when empty
	Allow contributing files without a source repository


red: -> rename to repoServer, and make serparate repoDaemon...?
	Add logging flag
	catch top level exceptions and see if this allows for proper cleanup of temp directories
	authentication via request address
	allow non-default manifest names and locations
	shutdown
	Access locking scheme where lock is removed 5 minutes after last access by a user
	Consider thread-locking manifest file object during entire operation
	Keep directories and manifest directories clean - remove when empty
	Allow changing flush interval
	Allow founding a new repository
	Cleanup empty temp directories - name with a prefix:

repoDaemon:
	...

rv:
	Repository vault
