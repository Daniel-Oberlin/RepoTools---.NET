How to use tools to create a new manifest copy (without using robocopy)

rt:
	Ability to validate a single file or directory
	Don't change root directory when specifying manifest, so that manifest can live elsewhere
	-deep option for -recursive, or -deepRecursive - check for manifests underneath manifests when recursive
	Ability to show file checksums
	Search upwards for manifest to allow narrow update, validate, etc.
	Utilize manifest information modified date
	Remove deprecated fields from ManifestFileInfo


rs:
	catch top level exceptions and see if this allows for proper cleanup of temp directories
	allow non-default manifest names and locations
	repair - define and implement


red:
	Add logging flag
	Lock manifests when using
	catch top level exceptions and see if this allows for proper cleanup of temp directories
	authentication via request address
	allow non-default manifest names and locations
	shutdown
	periodic update of loaded manifests
	Separate task queue for copying/moving files, which might take a long time and cause a request to timeout
