Is CryptRepositoryProxy using the most efficient tmp dir to prevent re-writing data on moves?

Java rewrite:
	Don't implement server
	Consolidate LocalRepositoryState into LocalRepositoryProxy
	Remove multithreading safeguards
	Use fixed temp naming convention like is done for CryptProxy
	Logging functionality
	Implement FTP proxy
