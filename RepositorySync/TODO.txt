Provide -detailDir option to only show affected directories
Allow recursive sync using GUID to pair up repos when possible
Provide -confirm option

Consider removing the use of temp directories and writing directly to final destination - at least for local repositories

Java rewrite:
	Unit testing
	Rename LocalRepository... FileSystemRepository...
	Consolidate LocalRepositoryState into LocalRepositoryProxy
	Don't implement server
	Remove multithreading safeguards
	Use fixed temp naming convention like is done for CryptProxy
	Logging functionality
	Implement FTP proxy
	Compress data before enrypting
