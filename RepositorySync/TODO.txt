Back out temp dir changes - not efficient because data must be hashed over network!

Implement repair

	This might help prevent re-use of bad sectors:
	Validate
	Move error files to .trash directory giving unique names or using original subpaths
	Update locally
	Update from source repo
	Retain .trash to prevent re-use of bad media or for analysis

	Or a simpler approach:
	Update
	Mirror
	?


Allow recursive sync using GUID to pair up repos when possible

Java rewrite:
	Don't implement server
	Consolidate LocalRepositoryState into LocalRepositoryProxy
	Remove multithreading safeguards
	Use fixed temp naming convention like is done for CryptProxy
	Logging functionality
	Implement FTP proxy
