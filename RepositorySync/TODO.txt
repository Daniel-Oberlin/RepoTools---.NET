HIGH:
Newly emptied directories are not being removed (ADDED LATER: on disk, I think I mean...?)

LOW:
Add "seed" which will copy the repository info only

Add "crypt", which is an encrypted archive
	* New implementation of RepositoryProxy, "CryptRepositoryProxy"
	* A crypt is an encrypted repository with a manifest
		* Files on disk are named by their hash for obfuscation
		* Files on disk are encrypted by the hash of their *unencrypted* data
		* Manifest contains an array of bytes which contain an encrypted inner manifest
		* Outer manifest manages encrypted files on disk, acts as a regular repository
		* Inner manifest is "virtual", and contains unencrypted filenames, locations, etc.
		* CryptRepositoryProxy takes a password which is used to unencrypt the inner manifest
		* CryptRepositoryProxy presents the inner manifest to RepoSync
		* CryptRepositoryProxy manages the mapping between the inner and outer manifest
