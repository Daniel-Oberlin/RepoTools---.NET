Consider removing the use of temp directories and writing directly to final destination - at least for local repositories

Allow recursive sync using GUID to pair up repos when possible

Java rewrite:
	Rename LocalRepository... FileSystemRepository...
	Don't implement server
	Consolidate LocalRepositoryState into LocalRepositoryProxy
	Remove multithreading safeguards
	Use fixed temp naming convention like is done for CryptProxy
	Logging functionality
	Implement FTP proxy
